h1. TabMenu

TabMenu is an easy way to create tabs for your Rails Application. It requires Rails 2.2.2 or greater

h2. Examples

<pre>
<%- tab_menu "user_menu tabbed" do |t| -%>
  <%= t.tab "Profile", "/account" %>
  <%= t.tab "Change Settings", "/account/edit" %>
<%- end -%>
</pre>

This will render:

<pre>
<ul class="user_menu tabbed">
  <li class="active"><a href="/account">Profile</a></li>
  <li><a href="/account/edit">Change Settings</li>
</ul>
</pre>

You can now set the current tab like so:

<pre>
  <%- tab_menu "user_menu", :current_tab => "profile" do |t| -%>
    <%= t.tab "Profile", "/account" %>
    <%= t.tab "Change Settings", "/account/edit" %>
  <%- end -%>
</pre>

note the active class is designated for the current url and that url helpers are allowed in the second argument
